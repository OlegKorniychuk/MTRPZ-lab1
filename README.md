# Quadratic equation solver
  This is a simple console app that solves quadratic equations.

## Installation & running
  Node.js required in order to run the app

  This solver has 2 modes.

  ### 1.Interactive mode
  User inputs a, b and c parameters values. Those must be real numbers, otherwise error will be thrown.
  Run app in interactive mode:
  ```
  node index.js
  ```

  ### 2.File mode
  In this mode app takes parameters values from a text file. Such file should contain ONLY 3 real numbers, separated by spaces (see example in file.txt). Otherwise the app will stop with an error.
  Run app in file mode:
  ```
  node index.js /absolute/path/to/your/file
  ```
